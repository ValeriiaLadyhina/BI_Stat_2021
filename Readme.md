In this project I performed statistical analysis of the data on Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. 
To analyse the data I used next R libraries:
* library(dplyr)
* library(knitr)
* library(kableExtra)
* library(ggplot2)
* library(tidyr)

Additionaly I installed package prettydoc to create better R markdown.
I used next kinds of statystical analysis:
* qqplot
* density plot
* violin plot
* boxplot
* t-test
* wilcox - test
* chi-squared test
* *etc.
